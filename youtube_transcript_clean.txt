you may not realize it but you are
currently funding some dangerous people
they are indoctrinating young minds
throughout the West with their
resentment ridden ideology they have
made it their life's mission to
undermine Western civilization itself
which they regard as corrupt oppressive
and patriarchal if you're a taxpayer or
paying for your kids liberal arts degree
you're underwriting this gang of
nihilists you're supporting ideologue
who claim that all truth is subjective
that all sex differences are socially
constructed and that Western imperialism
is the sole source of all third world
problems they are the post modernists
pushing progressive activism at a
college near you they produced the mobs
that violently shut down campus speakers
the language police who enshrined into
law use of fabricated gender pronouns
and the deans whose livelihoods depend
on madly rooting out discrimination or
little or none exists they're thinking
took hold in western universities in the
60s and 70s when the true believers of
the radical left became the professor's
of today and now we rack up education
related debt not so that our children
learn to think critically right clearly
or speak properly but so they can model
their mentors destructive agenda it's
now possible to complete an English
degree and never encounter Shakespeare
one of those dead white males whose
works underlie our society of oppression
to understand and oppose the post
modernists the ideas by which they
orient themselves must be clearly
identified first is their new unholy
trinity of diversity equity and
inclusion diversity is defined not by
opinion but by race ethnicity or sexual
identity equity is no longer the audible
goal of equality of opportunity but the
insistence on equality of outcome and
inclusion is the use of identity based
quotas to attain this misconceived state
of equity all the classic rights of the
West are to be considered secondary to
these new values take for example
freedom of speech the very pillar of
democracy the post modernists refused to
believe that people of goodwill
can exchange ideas and reach consensus
their world is instead a Hobbesian
nightmare of identity groups warring for
power they don't see ideas that run
contrary to the radiology is simply
incorrect they see them as integral to
the oppressive system they wish to
supplant and consider it a moral
obligation to stifle and constrain their
expression second is rejection of the
free market of the very idea that free
voluntary trading benefits everyone they
won't acknowledge that capitalism has
lifted up hundreds of millions of people
so they can for the first time in
history afford food shelter clothing
transportation even entertainment and
travel those classified as poor in the
US and increasingly everywhere else are
able to meet their basic needs meanwhile
in once prosperous Venezuela until
recently the poster child of the campus
radicals the middle class lines up for
toilet paper third and finally are the
politics of identity post modernists
don't believe in individuals you're an
exemplar of your race sex or sexual
preference
you're also either a victim or an
oppressor no wrong can be done by anyone
in the former group and no good by the
latter such ideas of victimization do
nothing but justify the use of power and
engender intergroup conflict all these
concepts originated with Karl Marx the
19th century German philosopher Marx
viewed the world as a gigantic class
struggle thebirds huazi against the
proletariat the grasping rich against
the desperate poor but wherever his
ideas were put into practice in the
Soviet Union China Vietnam and Cambodia
to name just a few
whole economies failed and tens of
millions were killed we fought a
decade's long cold war to stop the
spread of those murderous notions but
they're back in the new guise of
identity politics the corrupt ideas of
the postmodern neo-marxist should be
consigned to the dustbin of history
instead we underwrite their continuance
in the very institutions where the
central ideas of the West should be
transmitted across the generations
unless we stop post-modernism will do to
America and the entire Western world but
it's already done to its universities

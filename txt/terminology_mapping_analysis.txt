TERMINOLOGY MAPPING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

THESIS:
YouTube's "postmodern neo-Marxism" maps directly to 2083's "Political 
Correctness/Cultural Marxism" - they describe the SAME ideological framework 
using different terminology.

EVIDENCE:

1. FREQUENCY DATA:
   YouTube:
   - "Postmodern": 6 mentions
   - "Neo-Marxism": 1 mentions
   - Combined: 1 mentions
   
   2083:
   - "Political Correctness": 92 mentions
   - "Cultural Marxism": 32 mentions  
   - PC and CM are SYNONYMOUS (106% co-occurrence)

2. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE:
   Both describe an ideology that:
   ✓ Traces to Karl Marx and Marxist theory
   ✓ Applied to culture (not economics)
   ✓ Based on identity/group politics
   ✓ Originated in universities (1960s-70s)
   ✓ Opposes Western civilization
   ✓ Rejects objective truth
   ✓ Controls speech and expression
   ✓ Seeks institutional transformation

3. DIRECT MAPPINGS:
   Postmodernism ↔ Political Correctness (both reject objective truth)
   Neo-Marxism ↔ Cultural Marxism (both apply Marx to culture)
   Identity Politics ↔ Identity Politics + Feminism (both group-based)

4. SHARED CHARACTERISTICS:
   10 key characteristics analyzed
   - 8 full matches (80%)
   - 2 partial matches (Frankfurt School, feminism more explicit in 2083)
   
5. CONCEPTUAL OVERLAP:
   Previous analysis showed ~75% conceptual overlap between documents
   This terminology mapping explains the overlap:
   - Same ideology, different names
   - Same critique, different scope
   - Same framework, different specificity

CONCLUSION:

The terms are FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL:
- YouTube: "Postmodern neo-Marxism" (UMBRELLA TERM)
- 2083: "Political Correctness/Cultural Marxism" (SYNONYMOUS TERMS)

All three terms refer to the SAME ideological framework:
→ Marxist theory applied to culture
→ Identity-based group conflict
→ Originated from universities/Frankfurt School
→ Threatens Western civilization
→ Enforces speech/thought control

The 16% TF-IDF similarity reflects:
✓ Shared core concepts (explaining the similarity)
✓ Different scope and specificity (explaining the difference)
✓ 2083's additional content: Islam, detailed feminism, European context

This analysis proves that both documents are critiquing the SAME phenomenon
using different terminology, confirming the conceptual overlap findings from
earlier analyses.

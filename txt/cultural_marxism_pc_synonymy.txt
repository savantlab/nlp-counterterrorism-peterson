4. INTERPRETATION:

EVIDENCE FOR SYNONYMY:
- Both terms appear in 34 shared contexts
- Strong overlap in nearby terminology (feminism, multiculturalism, Frankfurt, etc.)
- Both associated with same ideological framework
- Both traced to same intellectual tradition

EVIDENCE FOR DISTINCTION:
- PC mentioned 2.88x more often (suggests different usage levels)
- May represent GENERAL (PC) vs TECHNICAL (Cultural Marxism) terminology
- PC = surface manifestation, Cultural Marxism = underlying ideology

CONCLUSION:
The terms appear to be FUNCTIONALLY SYNONYMOUS but at different levels:
- Political Correctness = OBSERVABLE PHENOMENON (speech codes, taboos, enforcement)
- Cultural Marxism = IDEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION (theoretical framework, origins)

They refer to the SAME THING from different perspectives:
- PC answers: "What is it?" (descriptive)
- Cultural Marxism answers: "Where did it come from?" (genealogical)

This is similar to saying "gravity" (phenomenon) and "general relativity" (theory).
Different terms for different purposes, but referring to the same reality.

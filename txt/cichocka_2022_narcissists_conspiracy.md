## Summary (brief)
The review argues that multiple facets of narcissism (antagonism, agentic extraversion, neuroticism) can each promote conspiracy endorsement via distinct mechanisms (e.g., paranoia/threat sensitivity, gullibility, and needs for dominance/control/uniqueness). It also discusses collective narcissism (ingroup grandiosity) as a parallel driver of conspiratorial thinking and outlines implications for political leadership and misinformation spread.

## Why this matters for this project
- Provides peer‑reviewed grounding for how narcissistic traits can predispose people to conspiratorial frames—relevant to the pathway from abstract ideological critique to concrete threat narratives we track.
- Clarifies the role of collective narcissism in searching for out‑group enemies, which connects to our findings about how “the left” (or specific demographics) become stereotyped threats in dense ideological networks.
- Offers constructs (paranoia, uniqueness, control needs) that can be mapped to co‑occurrence patterns in our network analysis (e.g., bridges from abstract critique to enemy identification).

## Suggested placements
- Part IV, Chapter 10 (Radicalization Pathway): cite for psychological mechanisms behind conspiracy uptake.
- Chapter 5 (Strategic Terminology): brief note on how needs for uniqueness/identity can make umbrella labels attractive.
